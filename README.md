# SSM: Semantic Similarity Measure

Semantic similarity measures has been used to compare different types of entities represented in a semantic-base. 
This software package provides the basic functions to start using semantic similarity.

The ssm.py file contains the function and some examples

The semanticbase.db contains the entries and teh relations between those entries

Each time the semantic base is updated, the preprocessing.sql contains SQL commands required to run before using ssm.py.
